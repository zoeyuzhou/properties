# Find My Next House
## Overview
This repository is to get desired data and organize them to help me find my next house. 

### Initial Design
3 python applications added:

* **realestateDomain**

   Using scrapy to crawl properties id and the school information about the properties from domain.
   Domain group has published some useful APIs, however, free account could not access some useful data...
    * Need to change "start_url" to get the first search result url by using filters to meet your own requirments.
    
* **domainApiClient**

   Using API provided by Domain group to get the property details.
    * Input is property_id.txt which generated by **realestateDomain** under ./data
    * Need to get your own free client number and security token for Authentication and Authorization.
    * There is 500 requests / day limit for free API usage. So clear your requirements first.
    * There is a test flag which need to set to False to get the live data.
    * https://developer.domain.com.au/docs/introduction
    
* **propertiesData**

   Using pandas to organize the property data.
    * Inputs are propertiesDetails.csv and property_school.csv which generated by **realestateDomain** and **domainApiClient** under ./data
   
* **data**

   The outputs example...
   
I would continue and add more functions until I bought my new house....
